CSS preprocessors are used to extend your CSS with functionality such as variables, functions, operators and mixins.SASS and LESS are two well known preprocessors but there are alot more to choose from.

CSS in larger projects can get pretty complex and preprocessors are there to make your task of writing and managing your CSS easier and decreasing the amount of code you have to write. In very small projects the need for a preprocessor isn´t as high and can feel a bit redundant.

For this page i used SASS but given that the task is not very big or complex i didn´t use alot of it´s functionality but i made use of variables for some colors. In a project of this size i wouldn´t say SASS is that useful. I could just as well have done my stylesheet in standard CSS without having to add that much more code but learning a bit of it was interesting and i can see the need for it in bigger projects.

Some of the pros of using preprocessors are less repetition of code, easier maintainability, modularity, timesaving, the availability if using functions, variables ,mixins and operations. On the disadvantage side it can be harder to debug your CSS code altho there is tools that can help with this. A preprocessor can also impact performance and you have less control over how big you CSS files are.
