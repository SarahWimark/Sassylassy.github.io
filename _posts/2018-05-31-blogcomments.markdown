Blog posts are kinda useless without a commentsection donÂ´t you think? To help with this there are some great tools out there you can use to make this feature easy to add and maintain. One of those tools are Disqus and that is what i used to enable commenting in this blog.

Go to [this site](https://disqus.com){:target="_blank"} to make an account and follow the instructions to begin setting up your own commentfeatures.
