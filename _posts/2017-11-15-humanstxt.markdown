Adding the file humans.txt to your project is a way to give information about the people that has contributed in building the website. 
ItÂ´s just a normal textfile with the information about the contributors in plain text. You can also give some information about the site like when it was released, last updated and what languages was used in building it.

All you have to do to use it is to place a file in the rootfolder of your site and name it humans.txt. You should also make it UTF-8 encoded to support special characters and characters from different languages. In the `<head>` part of your site you then place a reference to the file.

`<link rel="author" href="humans.txt" />`
