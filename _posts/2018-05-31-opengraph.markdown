Open graph was introduces by Facebook in 2010 as a way to chose what content you want displayed when someone shares your webpage. You can choose different tags such as title for the pages title, image that is shown when the page is shared, description about the pages content and type for the type of content that is being shared.

For this site i used the type, title, url and image tags to choose which content is displayed when someone shares my page.
